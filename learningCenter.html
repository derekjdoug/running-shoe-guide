        <h1>What Are the Different Running Shoe Types?</h1>
        <div>
          <h2>Neutral vs. Stability</h2>
          <p>Neutral shoes are designed for runners with high arches and feet that do not over-pronate. Pronation is
            when your arch collapses and your foot rolls in when you take a stride. Neutral runners feet pronate very
            little, if it all. With that in mind, neutral shoes provide no added stability to prevent over-pronation.
          </p>
          <p>Stability shoes are designed for runners with lower arches, or feet that over-pronate. Again, pronation is
            when your arch collapses and your foot rolls in when you take a stride. Sound scary? Relax! Pronation is
            totally normal, and some studies suggest it can actually play a role in preventing injury. Stability shoes
            provide extra support on the inside of the shoe that keep your feet comfortable by limiting the amount of
            pronation your feet will experience.</p>

          <h2>Normal Cushion vs. Max Cushion</h2>
          <p>Shoes that are cushioned a "normal" amount (keep in mind, that can be different from brand to brand) tend
            to be comfortable, lightweight, and appropriate for short to medium range runs. They have less cushion than
            max cushion models, meaning that they tend to be lighter and less bulky. Many runners who wish to use their
            shoe as a cross trainer in the gym, or when playing other sports, may prefer them for these reasons.</p>
          <p>Max cushion shoes are extra plush for a comfortable ride! Runners that run longer distances, are heavier,
            older, or have joint pain may enjoy the extra cushion these shoes provide--or, you could be none of those
            things and just enjoy the feeling of a softer ride! The downsides are that max cushion shoes tend to be
            bulkier, weigh more, and are usually less appropriate for other activities.</p>

          <h2>Other Important Tips</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Running shoes should be approximately 1/2 to 1 size larger than your casual shoes (your feet will swell
              during runs or workouts)</li>
            <li>Buy for comfort, not for looks!</li>
            <li>Try on competing shoes from several brands to ensure you find the shoes that work best for your feet
            </li>
            <li>Replace your running shoes every 400 miles or after 12 months of consistant use</li>
          </ul>
