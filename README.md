# running-shoe-guide

This application is designed to help users pick the perfect running shoe based on their responses specified in an interactive questionnaire. After they've received three suggestions from competing brands, users are able to read more about why that type of running shoe is right for them.

### Reflections and Comments

- There are many different ways to handle the logic of a quiz in JavaScript. Because or quiz features sets of 2 answers for each question, we decided to use boolean as our data type to keep things simple and tidy.
